# Supporting ubugeeei's Activities

Hello, I'm ubugeeei. \
I'm a member of [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs) and [Vue.js JP](https://github.com/vuejs-jp), and the king of [chibivue land](https://github.com/chibivue-land).

Currently, I work as a tech lead at a company during the day, and spend my free time on Vue.js-related community activities. \
If you'd like to support my efforts or become a sponsor, please consider sponsorship!

## Vision

I have several major goals in my community activities:

- Revitalize the Vue.js community in Japan
- Design a sustainable community
- Continue contributing to Vue.js-related OSS

Below are the concrete achievements and future directions for realizing these visions!

### As a Vue.js Team Member

I participated in the initial development of [vuejs/vue-vapor](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-vapor), which led to me becoming a Vue.js team member. \
While I'm not currently making active commits, I hope to contribute not only to Vapor Mode but also to [vuejs/core](https://github.com/vuejs/core) and [vuejs/language-tools](https://github.com/vuejs/language-tools) as much as possible in the future. \

### As a Vue.js JP Team Member

I participate as core staff in [Vue.js JP](https://github.com/vuejs-jp), organizing the annual [Vue Fes Japan](https://vuefes.jp/) and serving as organizing staff and speaker for [community meetups](https://vuejs-meetup.connpass.com/) (mainly v-tokyo) held every few months. \
We are all volunteers with limited resources. I focus particularly on packaging and documentation to ensure the community remains sustainable.

### As the Author of chibivue

The project that made my name known is [chibivue](https://github.com/ubugeeei/chibivue).  
It's a hands-on guide explaining how to build Vue.js from scratch, which has become widely known both domestically and internationally.  
I believe this book serves as a guide for future Vue.js contributors!

### As the Operator of chibivue land

chibivue has grown beyond just an online book into a community.  
I manage a Discord server called [chibivue land](https://chibivue-land), which serves as a hub where people connect and support each other.  
The server is open to anyone, bringing together diverse people from casual users to Vue.js core members.

### As an Educator

I love teaching and sharing knowledge. \
Through chibivue land and social media, I teach programming to community members and support their speaking and writing activities (including planning and reviews).
I plan to continue these educational activities and further expand Vue.js adoption. \
Activity examples:
- [Reading vuejs/core-vapor](https://github.com/ubugeeei/reading-vuejs-core-vapor)
- [Vue Beginners](https://zenn.dev/vue_beginners)
- [VueYous](https://github.com/chibivue-land/vueyous)
- [Vue.js is not Easy. It is Approachable.](https://ublog.dev/blog/vue-is-approachable)
- [Technology Behind Reactive Props Destructure](https://zenn.dev/comm_vue_nuxt/articles/reactive-props-destructure)
- [Vue Reactivity 0:present](https://ubugeeei.github.io/v-tokyo-22)

### Other Activities

In addition to these roles, I'm involved in various Vue.js-related activities. \
