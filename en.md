# Supporting ubugeeei's Activities

Hello, I'm ubugeeei. \
I'm a member of [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs) and [Vue.js JP](https://github.com/vuejs-jp), and the author of [chibivue](https://github.com/chibivue-land/chibivue) and [vize](https://github.com/ubugeeei/vize).

Currently, I work as a chief engineer at [@mates-system](https://github.com/mates-system) during the day, and spend my free time on Vue.js-related community activities. \
If you'd like to support my efforts or become a sponsor, please consider sponsorship!

## Vision

I have several major goals in my community activities:

- Revitalize the Vue.js community in Japan
- Design a sustainable community
- Continue contributing to Vue.js-related OSS

Below are the concrete achievements and future directions for realizing these visions!

### As a Vue.js Team Member

I participated in the initial development of [vuejs/vue-vapor](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-vapor), which led to me becoming a Vue.js team member. \
I'm no longer actively involved in Vapor Mode, and am now focused on developing [vize](https://github.com/ubugeeei/vize). \

### As an OSS Developer

I develop personal OSS projects to improve the Vue.js ecosystem and web development.

It includes an SFC compiler, linter, formatter, type checker, SSR support, LSP, and more.

### As the Author of chibivue

The project that made my name known is [chibivue](https://github.com/chibivue-land/chibivue).
It's a hands-on guide explaining how to build Vue.js from scratch, which has become widely known both domestically and internationally.
I believe this book serves as a guide for future Vue.js contributors!

### As the Founder of chibivue land

chibivue has grown beyond just an online book into a community. \
I founded a Discord server called [chibivue land](https://chibivue.land), creating a hub where people connect and support each other. \
I have since handed over the management to other members.


### As an Educator

I love teaching and sharing knowledge. \
Through chibivue land and social media, I teach programming to community members and support their speaking and writing activities (including planning and reviews). \
I plan to continue these educational activities and further expand Vue.js adoption. \
