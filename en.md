# Supporting ubugeeei's Activities

Hello, I'm ubugeeei. \
I'm a member of [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs) and [Vue.js JP](https://github.com/vuejs-jp), and the author of [chibivue](https://github.com/chibivue-land/chibivue) and [vize](https://github.com/ubugeeei/vize).

I work as a chief engineer at [@mates-system](https://github.com/mates-system) during the day, and spend my free time on Vue.js community activities. \
Please consider sponsorship!

### As a Vue.js Team Member

### As the Author of chibivue

[chibivue](https://github.com/chibivue-land/chibivue) is the project that made my name known.
A hands-on guide to building Vue.js from scratch, widely known domestically and internationally.
I believe it guides future Vue.js contributors!

### As the Founder of chibivue land

chibivue grew from an online book into a community. \
