# Support ubugeeei's work

Hello, I am ubugeeei, a member of [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs) and the [Vue.js Japan User Group](https://github.com/vuejs-jp), owner of [chibivue land](https://github.com/chibivue-land).  
Thank you so much for showing interest in my activities!

Currently, I work as a tech lead at a regular company during the day, and in my personal time, I engage in community activities related to Vue.js. 
All of the activities mentioned below are carried out during my private time.

I have several major goals for my community involvement:

- To invigorate the Vue.js community in Japan
- To continue contributing to OSS related to Vue.js
- To spread Vue.js more widely and encourage more people to use it

Below are some specific achievements and future directions to realize these visions!

- **As a member of the Vue.js development team**  
  I joined the development of [vuejs/core-vapor](https://github.com/vuejs/core-vapor) from its early stages, which led me to become a member of Vue.js. After a brief personal hiatus, Iâ€™ve resumed my activities, and I'm now focusing again on feature development, optimization, and promoting Vue.js. I believe Vapor Mode is at the core of the next generation of Vue.js, advancing the framework significantly. Moving forward, I aim to contribute not only to Vapor Mode but also to [vuejs/core](https://github.com/vuejs/core) and [vuejs/language-tools](https://github.com/vuejs/language-tools) as much as possible.

- **As the author of chibivue**  
  A significant project that helped to spread my name is [chibivue](https://github.com/ubugeeei/chibivue), a hands-on book about building Vue.js from scratch, which has become widely known, particularly within the Japanese community. However, the book is not yet complete. Further improvements and continued writing are necessary to finish it. I believe this book will serve as a guide for future Vue.js contributors!

- **As a community leader**  
  I am currently involved in managing several Vue.js communities and events:  
  - **Vue.js Japan User Group**  
    I participate as a core staff member of the [Vue.js Japan User Group](https://github.com/vuejs-jp). In this role, I help organize [Vue Fes Japan](https://vuefes.jp/2024), the largest Vue.js event in Japan, held annually, as well as [community meetups](https://vuejs-meetup.connpass.com/) (mainly v-tokyo) held every few months. In 2024, I took the lead in planning and creating content for the hands-on workshops, as well as participated as a panelist.\

  - **chibivue land**  
    In addition to being the author of chibivue, the project has evolved into a community. I manage a Discord server known as "[chibivue land](https://discord.gg/aVHvmbmSRy)," which has become a hub for people to connect, host events, and support one another. The server aims to be an open and inclusive community where anyone can participate, attracting a diverse range of people, from casual users to core Vue.js team members. I aim to expand the community further and grow it into a larger space.

- **As an educator**  
  I have always loved teaching and sharing knowledge. I regularly host study sessions on the chibivue server, provide programming tutorials to community members on an ad-hoc basis, assist with presentations and writing (including planning and reviewing), and run a beginner-oriented media outlet called [Vue Beginners](https://zenn.dev/vue_beginners). I plan to continue these educational activities and expand Vue.js's reach even further.\

- **Other activities**  
  Beyond these roles, I engage in various activities related to Vue.js, such as hosting a monthly Twitter space called "[chibi-taaalk!](https://x.com/search?q=%23%E3%81%A1%E3%81%B3%E3%81%A8%E3%83%BC%E3%83%BC%E3%81%8F&src=typed_query)" to promote the Japanese Vue.js community, writing detailed articles on new technologies related to Vue.js, and sometimes participating in discussions on Twitter. I will continue to actively take on whatever tasks I feel are necessary for the growth of Vue.js.

In the future, I plan to create a system that allows me to dedicate my working hours to these activities.
